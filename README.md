Complete graphing algorithms in C89 that cover linked lists, binary trees and closed-loop graphs. Variants in other languages to follow that are so far planned for C++ and Objective-C.

These solutions do not use recursion for obvious reasons, instead preferring pointer to functions.

NOTE: This is work in progress so I am adding, refactoring and generally having fun geeking out.
